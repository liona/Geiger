# Geiger

This application takes an input of 1s and 0s from a port and outputs those along with the timecode for when the signal was registered to a specified file.  It was originally written to interact with Sparkfun's geiger counter (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11345).  The executable can be accesssed directly by navigating to \GeigerCounts\bin\Debug\GeigerCounts.exe.  Please improve.
